# ArcFace in MindSpore

## Introduction
MindSpore is a new generation of full-scenario AI computing framework launched by Huawei in August 2019 and released On March 28, 2020.

This repository is the mindspore implementation of ArcFace and has achieved great performance. We implemented two versions based on ResNet and MobileNet to meet different needs.

## How to Training

The example commands below show how to run distributed training.


```shell
# Distributed training example
bash scripts/run_distribute_train.sh rank_size /path/dataset

# Evaluation example
bash scripts/run_eval.sh /path/evalset /path/ckpt
```
